Berkeley Sensor Database,"The Sensor Database includes millions of measurements from hundreds of sensor devices located in University of California Natural Reserve System. These sensors record temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and relative humidity at high resolution increments.",http://sensor.berkeley.edu/,n/a because no IPT,University of California's Natural Reserve System,"University of California's Natural Reserve System (UCNRS) is a network of protected natural areas throughout California. Its 39 sites include more than 756,000 acres, making it the largest university-administered reserve system in the world. Most major state ecosystems are represented, from coastal tide pools to inland deserts, and lush wetlands to Sierra Nevada forests. The reserves also serve as a gateway to more than a million acres of public lands. Founded in 1965 to provide undisturbed environments for research, education, and public service, the Natural Reserve System contributes to the understanding and wise stewardship of the earth.
