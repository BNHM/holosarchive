Soil biogeochemistry is intimately connected to the underlying geology, climate, hydrological cycle, as well as biota and their ecological interactions. UC Berkeley is one of the founding centers of the study of the biogeochemical forces that form soils, and is host to an extensive collection of samples from across California from the early 20th century.

Vertebrates and Invertebrates from the Pleistocene and Holocene <br>Students employed by the Ecoengine project cataloged and georeferenced 31,328 Pleistocene and Holocene vertebrate and invertebrate fossils. Most of these fossils localities were predominantly from California. These newly digitized records comprise approximately 6% of all georeferenced records in the UCMP database and are now available for mapping and modeling through the Explore Tool under Observation Type: Fossils.

Berkeley Natural History Museums<br>The BNHM collections are host to millons of vouchered specimes covering arthropods, amphibians, birds, reptiles, mammals, vascular plants, mosses, lichens, fungi, as well as fossils. Thanks to dedicated staff and generous funding these collections are actively being updated and transitioned to online. To assist these collections in the efforts to mobilize valuable data the Ecoengine team targeted specific specimens to digitize, catalog, and georeference.

California's Ticks and Bees<br>With Ecoengine funding, the Essig Museum hired students to image, recurate, and database 700+ tick specimens collected in California over the last century by Professors Deane Furman and Robert Lane. These specimens are being used by researchers to further understand the complex interactions between Sudden Oak Death (SOD), Lyme disease, ticks and tick hosts.

Professor Roger Byrne and his lab at UC Berkeley have worked for many years to reconstruct past environments and ecological change by collecting and studying fossil pollen found within sediment cores. They have collected over fifty sediment cores across California and western North America, from which representative pollen slides are now in the UCMP collection. Critical data associated with these slides is being added to the UCMP database, and will significantly improve our ability to reconstruct vegetation changes over the last 15,000 years.

A significant goal of the Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine project was to uncover "dark" data, mobilize isolated collections, and digitize targeted specimens within the Berkeley Natural History Museums and Berkeley's research labs. The collections listed below were recovered, organized, databased, georeferenced, connected and/or made available for public use by our staff and undergraduate students. These data become available for exploration in the Explore and Compare tools.

   Berkeley Sensor Database<br>The Ecoengine is connected to an environmental sensor array housed Angelo Coast Range Reserve. The array was first established as part of a Keck Foundation grant for the project Keck Hydrowatch and has been maintained and expanded through various other projects including the NSF-funded, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory.

   Specimens from the VTM Collection    <br>To achieve the full digitization of the Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) collection (photos, maps, plots, and specimens), the Ecoengine partnered with the University and Jepson Herbaria to georeference VTM specimens within their collection. In total, 7,293 specimen records were corrected or were assigned new coordinates. The Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH) database added a "Vegetation Type Map specimen" checkbox to their interface to allow users to easily identify this collection. 


We selected several individuals and groups to work with who shared our vision for clean design, data rich content and the desire to communicate scientific content as broadly as possible.

The Vegetation Type Mapping Homepage lets users explore vegetation, plot, and photo data from the Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping project.  In the 1920s and 1930s Albert Everett Wieslander and several others explored much of California's wilderness sampling vegetation, taking photographs, collecting plant specimens, and drawing detailed maps of what they found. These data represent a snapshot of California's vegetation in the early 20th century, and are a valuable resource for comparative and conservation ecology. This website has more information about the collection, detailed information about using the data, and data downloads.
The reservemapper  application helps users discover natural history observations, specimens, and photos associated with reserves, parks, and special districts.  Select one of the following links to populate reservemapper with agency specific reserves, units, or parks:
<br>The Ecoengine API has endpoints that can be accessed by a variety of tools.  In addition to the applications featured on the Holos Homepage, this page catalogs additional use cases and sites demonstrating the use of the Berkeley Ecoengine.
