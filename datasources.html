There are two ways that collections are harvested for use in the Ecoengine: via IPT and non-IPT.</span></p>\n<p>Most of the large specimens collections have been published online through an IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit). The IPT allows data aggregators to integrate a collection's DarwinCore Archive directly from the originating institution in a predictable format. You can read more about the IPT <a href="http://www.gbif.org/ipt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The non-IPT resources are generally smaller and abiotic, and some were mobilized through various grant funded projects. The <a href="/ecoengine-data/data-discover/berkeley-soil-collection/">Berkeley Soil Collection</a>, was organized and curated as part of the Ecoengine grant. The <a href="/ecoengine-data/data-discover/nrs-sensor-data/">Berkeley Sensor Database</a> was funded by the <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/research/special_projects/Keck_HydroWatchl.htm" target="_blank">Keck Hydrowatch</a> grant. These collections were made into a SQL database and are hosted and served via the Ecoengine without the use of an IPT. There are also large, older and well-established resources, such as <a href="/ecoengine-data/data-discover/calphotos/">Calphotos</a>, that are non-IPT.</p>\n<p>The table below lists all of the collections that are in the Ecoengine. You can tell if they have an IPT by looking at the "External Link" for non-IPT sources and "Metadata Source" for IPT sources.</p>
